TEST This repo contains the code and data to reproduce all results and
figures in the 2021 JGR: Biogeosciences publication: **Mineral
protection and resource limitations combine to explain profile-scale
carbon persistence**.

`PuuEke_AllData.xlsx` contains all of the geochemical data used in
analyses as well as some microbial data and a README tab explaining data
types and units. `MPC_16S_phyloseq_2019_07_23.rds` is a phyloseq object,
ready for import in R.

The R Markdown files are configured to read directly from the
spreadsheet and phyloseq object on the user’s desktop.

Each RMarkdown file regenerates all results and figures used in the
manuscript. The `.md` files in this repo show formatted code output. The
`.Rmd` files can be downloaded to run and edit on your local machine.

`Figures_Geochem.md` shows data processing for geochemical data.
`Figures_Microbial.md` shows data processing for microbial data.
